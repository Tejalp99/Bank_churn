# BANK CHURN PREDICTION

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT 

Businesses like banks that provide several services have to keep frequent check on a major problem of churn rate or rate of attrition.
Now what does the term CHURN RATE denote: it is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period.
In other words it is important for banks to evaluate what kind of services influence a customer's choice to take up a particular service.
Companies from this sector usually have service branches that try to win over their lost customers, as it is always better to recover lost customers rather than spending resources on new recruited clients.


AIM OF THE PROJECT:

2) To build a predictive model that performs
    a) Classification of the customer that are participating in the churn or not.
    b) Then building a machine learning model which is attach to the probability to the churn further helping to classify and target that can prevent churn.
